    "## Objective\n",
    "Apply transfer learning techniques to fine-tune a pre-trained model in PyTorch for a multi-class classification task: distinguishing between images of cats, dogs, and foxes. This project develops skills in dataset preparation, model fine-tuning, and performance evaluation.\n",
    "## Problem Description\n",
    "Cats, dogs, and foxes are often confused due to their physical similarities, such as fur patterns, ear shapes, and size. This project aims to create a machine learning model that classifies images into one of three categories:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Cat\n",
    "* Dog\n",
    "* Fox\n",
    "\n",
    "Using transfer learning, this project leverages the pre-trained ResNet model from PyTorch to develop an effective classification system."

    "1. Use or create a dataset with labeled images of cats, dogs, and foxes. Suggested sources include public image datasets such as those on Kaggle.\n",
